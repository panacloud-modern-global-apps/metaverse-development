        * [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification)
* **Quarter 5: Front-end Web GUI Development using Next.js and TypeScript:** Next.js is designed to handle complex front-end applications well, making it a good fit for AI applications that might grow in features and data usage over time. Next.js offers features like API routes and file-based routing, which can streamline development for AI applications that need to interact with backend APIs and manage different application views. While Next.js and TypeScript aren't the only options for building AI application frontends, their focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience makes them a compelling choice for many developers.

Generative AI is set to revolutionise our daily lives and work environments. According to McKinsey & Company, generative AI could contribute an annual economic value of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion across various sectors by enhancing automation, bolstering decision-making, and providing personalised experiences. This revolution is pivotal for technology and job landscapes, making it essential knowledge in fast-evolving tech cycles. The rapid emergence of Gen AI-powered technologies and the evolving demand for skills necessitate extensive and timely professional training.

Cloud native is an approach in software development that enables application creation, deployment, and management in cloud environments. It involves constructing applications as a collection of small, interconnected services known as microservices, a shift from traditional monolithic structures. This modular approach enhances the agility of cloud-native applications, allowing them to operate more efficiently with fewer resources.

Technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, serverless containers, APIs, SQL Databases, and Kafka support developers in swiftly constructing cloud-native applications. These tools offer a standardised platform for application development and management across various cloud services like Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS.
