## The Plan in a Nutshell

The target is to train 1 Million developers across Pakistan who are experts in Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Metaverse Technologies. 

The first batch of 3,710 students will start their training on Tuesday, September 27.

Given the current financial situation in the country, we are combining our teaching and dollar-making business activities. This is going to be a totally new kind of program where students will be taught during the classes how to earn dollars i.e. Earn while you Learn.

During the next phase, we will select 50 top students, make them faculty members, and start classes in 50 cities/universities across Pakistan. In this phase, we will be training 20,000 (50 x 400) students, Insha Allah.

In the third phase, we will spread to all districts of Pakistan and make it a software development hub in this coming age of Web 3.0 and Metaverse. 

May God help us in this movement to save Pakistan. 


## Panaverse Certified Web 3.0 and Metaverse Developer Tranining Program

The internet is undoubtedly the most significant technological development in human history. Although the industry has progressed immensely since its inception, we are just scratching the surface of what it can do for us. Web3 and metaverse technologies improves the internet as we know it today by adding innovative new features and enhancements. The metaverse reimagines the frontend, and web3 the backend of the web. Web 3.0 and the Metaverse will work together and complement each other in the future. Whereas Web 3.0 is primarily concerned with who will own and rule the internet of the future, the metaverse concept is concerned with how users will interact with it. When the metaverse world would come to fruition, it may be centralised (as in Web 2.0), decentralised (as in Web 3.0), or a hybrid of the two. In any case, it is likely that the world will be powered by NFTs (i.e. unique tokens).

Citi is the latest Wall Street firm to issue a bullish forecast for web3 and the metaverse, which describe a future internet vision based on decentralised technologies and virtual worlds. Citi said in a [research report published in March 2022](https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/metaverse-and-money/) that the metaverse economy could have a <strong>total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and can capture five bullion users by 2030</strong>. We suggest you download the Citi's research report from [here](https://ir.citi.com/gps/x5%2BFQJT3BoHXVu9MsqVRoMdiws3RhL4yhF6Fr8us8oHaOe1W9smOy1%2B8aaAgT3SPuQVtwC5B2%2Fc%3D)

[Tech Giants Create Metaverse Standards Forum for Software and Terminology Standards](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/22/tech-giants-create-metaverse-standards-forum-for-software-and-terminology-standards/)

This program focuses on developing full-stack Web 3.0 and Metaverse experiences for the next generation of the internet by specializing in building worlds that merge the best of cutting-edge decentralized distributed blockchains with 3D metaverse client experiences (including Web 2.0 centralized serverless cloud technologies). 

After completing this program you will be able to develop 2D and 3D experiences that scale instantly to support even the most demanding applications, while at the same time delivering up to 90% cost savings. This stack which will be covered in this program is ideal for a broad set of applications. For example, enterprises that have hundreds of thousands of applications, or software as a service (SaaS) vendors that have multi-tenant environments with hundreds or thousands of databases, can use this stack across the entire enterprise both for 2D and 3D development.

The term metaverse is a combination of the Greek words meta, which means "beyond," "transcending," or "more comprehensive," and english word universe, which means "all existing matter and space." The options for entering virtual reality are limited to open and closed metaverses. Because there is no single, universal vision of a 3D virtual world on which everyone can agree, we believe the Metaverse will be made up of a number of open and closed ecosystems.

You can think of the stack which we will cover in this course in terms of layers. The first layer is the Web 2.0 technologies which provide the tools to develop 2D frontends and a highly scalable and cost effective cloud backend. The second layer is the Web 3.0 technologies that is built using the first layer and the Ethereum blockchain. The third layer replaces the 2D frontends with 3D and XR technologies for developing metaverse experiences. In the third layer we use all the backend technologies included in the first two layers, only the frontend changes. The third metaverse layer can be based on open and closed ecosystems.

The Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 layers can easily be extended to develop Metaverse experiences, which is the third layer in our stack. The backend will remain more less the same, the front-end will move towards 3D XR experiences from 2D user interfaces.


The metaverse development stack can be may be an open ecosystem with browser acting as a sort of operating system:

1. [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/)
2. [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/)
3. [Three.js](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals)
4. [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), [100ms](https://www.100ms.live/), and [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) called [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type). ( [Watch Metaverse experience with WebRTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QPentc_Gv4) )
6. [Webaverse](https://docs.webaverse.com/docs/index)

For more details check out the [Panaverse's Open Metaverse learning repo](https://github.com/panaverse/metaverse-web).

Currently, it seems that Apple, Meta, and Microsoft are going to introduce closed metaverse ecosystems. Unity 3D may be the best option to develop for these platforms: 

1. [Unity 3D XR Development Platform](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html)
2. [C# for Unity XR Programming](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html)

Blockchain Project: Create a Token and Launch ICO/IEO/IDO

As you probably know, the ICO ("Initial Coin Offering") industry has been booming, and it's completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, go have a look at [Wikipedia's list of highest crowdfunding projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), and you'll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

Your first task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IEO on the [Binance Launch Pad](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/94ed108ce89d44ab8602aa3c476dfb04).

Note: Also document the alternatives to Binance Launchpad.


Project Part 2: How to Launch a IDO on Polkastarter

Review the [list of top fundraising platforms](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms)

Your second task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IDO on the [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/).


Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating an token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralised service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use openzeppelin contracts. You will use Harkhat development envirnoment. Also, write at least 20 automated tests. We will be using the Solidity and Typescript for dvelopment.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible to allow users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to
Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal "owner" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the [openzeppelin crowd sale contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales), however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write exentisive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts was uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to "register" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the "Add token" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on "Add custom token" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

[Read](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/)

Now use [Gnosis Safe]{https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

[You may follow this tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/send-token-etherjs/)


Project Part 8 Advance: Create, Deploy, Mint, and Sell a NFT

[Read this NFT tutorial series](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)

Create a NFT contract using the [OpenZepplen ERC721 NFT Standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

You may use the [Preset ERC721 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#Presets).

Deploy your NFT contract on a testnet, mint it, and view it on the MetaMask wallet and list it on [OpenSea Marketplace](https://opensea.io/) for sale.

## Appendix

## Appendix A: Key Concepts

## Web 3.0

[Web 3.0](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b) is a concept for the internet's next generation. It is the evolution of user control and ownership over their creations and online content, digital assets, and online identities. Users in Web 3.0 can create content while owning, controlling, and monetizing it through the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

## Metaverse

While precise definitions are difficult to come by, the metaverse is generally thought to be a network of 3-D virtual worlds where people can interact, conduct business, and form social connections using their virtual "avatars." Consider it a virtual reality version of today's internet.

The definition of the metaverse extends beyond virtual worlds such as gaming and virtual reality applications. The broader vision of the metaverse includes smart manufacturing technology, virtual advertising, online events such as concerts, and digital currencies such as Ethereum.

## Serverless Cloud Computing

Web2 centralized serverless cloud technologies will also play a major role on the internet in the short to medium term until Web3 technologies mature and totally replace web2 technologies. 


### Web3 Metaverse: Decentraland and Sandbox on Ethereum

The most popular Metaverse projects at the moment are Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND), which provide virtual worlds where users can interact, buy land via an Ethereum smart contract, and live in an alternate reality. Both operate entirely on the Ethereum blockchain and allow users to buy real estate and build properties with cryptocurrencies, with SAND offering user-generated content that gives it limitless creative power. Panaverse will cover these projects in depth. 

To provide Web 3 functionality we will use the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain and [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) programming language for smart contract development. 


### The AR Glasses: Apple AR Glasses

As discussed in detail in this [article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3654197/enterprise-ar-will-be-dominated-by-apple-and-magic-leap.html) we also believe that Apple will lead the AR and Metaverse space on the glasses side. There [M1 processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) are the most efficient processors in the world. Some derivative of the M1 will power the Apple AR glasses. Apple's [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) is also quite mature. Apple's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language is extremely powerfull. The combination of the hardware and the software stacks will be extremely difficult to beat in the next few years. The main competetors Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google are three to five years behind right now. As developers the only down side is going to be the total lock-in.  

### Cloud Computing: AWS Serverless Computing

On the backend in the medium term Web3 technologies will be complemented by Web2 [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) Cloud combined with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) will provide an extremely scalable platform, with Typescript as the programming language of choice.

### Part 2: Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD)

Universal Scene Description (USD) is an open source framework developed by Pixar for exchanging 3D computer graphics data across different applications. It is designed to be flexible and extensible to other collaborative environments that run interconnected tools, such as NVIDIA Omniverse. More than a dozen companies from Apple, Nvidia, Adobe, to Unity support USD. The standard is on the cusp of becoming the solder that fuses all sorts of virtual and physical worlds into a metaverse.
